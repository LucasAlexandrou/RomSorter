# RomSorter

This is a simple Java application that will sort your messy ROM folder into the their dedicated folder based on their file extension (their system). 

Current plans are to support systems with unique to the system file types. So systems like GB, GBC, GBA, SNES, NES, PC ENGINE etc. 
For disc-based ROMs that are not clear as to which system they are for will just be moved to a "Multi-Disc" folder. However these ROMs are very large and may take too long to move anyway so it is recommended to use this for older systems.
